# Pandora's Box

**Category** : OSINT
**Points** : 588

Recently, an anonymous viewer has sent you a follow request, they know who you are, but you don't know who they are. They will reveal their identity provided you give them a secret flag. Sounds simple enough right? Think again. The only information you have is the account itself. As Pandora's Box is presented to you, do you have the courage to open it?
