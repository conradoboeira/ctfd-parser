Oops, looks like i zoomed in too much on google maps. Since you're mon amie I'll help you out a bit. This place is always busy, especially during weekdays. Its a nice spot since its right in the centre of town. I wouldn't want to spend a night there though. Located far from away from what you think but with 3-4 other states that go together.

Whats city is this place in?
